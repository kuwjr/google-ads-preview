A simple frontend app created using HTML and Angular Js to display the preview of a google ad before being published.
The frontend is styled using <a href="https://getskeleton.com/">skeleton</a> and a custom style sheets.
I would like to show my gratitude to @asthonyoon for the crispy iphone 11 design, I couldn't find his github profile, so checkout his <a href="https://codepen.io/asthonyoon">codepen profile</a> here.
